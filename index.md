My name is Owen Snyder and I am currently pursuing a Master of Statistics degree at NC State. This github page will be **dedicated to my work in ST558**, along with **other interesting coding projects** I have completed on my own or during my time at NC State! My interests lie within the world of finance, specifically *risk management* and *market risk*. Concepts like

  *Value at Risk   
  *Expected Shortfall   
  *Volatility  
  
have been some of the most interesting and important ideas I have learned while completing a finance concentration for my master's degree. However, I am also a huge baseball fan (**Go Mariners**) and love to play around with MLB data in R, so I hope to include some of that here.

Feel free to reach out at owsnyder@ncsu.edu
