As someone who came from a pure math background, the debate between data scientists and statisticians became apparent to me once I started my Masters of Statistics. Through various courses I’ve taken at NCSU and these four articles, I have come to realize the difference between data scientists and statisticians. 

Being a data scientist is like a happy medium between being good at software engineering and statistics. They are also skilled in making better decisions by means of performing robust analytics. Now, there are many necessary fields that data scientist must be experts in. These fields are computer science, mathematics/statistics, and domain knowledge.

There is some overlap between data scientists and statisticians. For example, they are similar in the fact that they both need extensive statistics knowledge. A data scientist can be good at working with large data sets, but they must be able to know how to approach the data statistically. Conversely, the main difference is that data scientists can be better at computer programming than statisticians. Being a good statistician requires knowledge of R, Python, or SAS to be able to represent statistical concepts through data. However, data scientists spend much more time programming than do statisticians in school. Another difference is that data scientists focus on comparing many different methods to create the best machine learning model, while statisticians usually work to improve a single best model. 

In relation to these two fields, I am more of a statistician. This is partly because statistics is what I’m studying through this master’s program. I thoroughly enjoy being a statistician; however, I have come to realize that I need to develop better programming skills. I believe that this class will give me the abilities to become a better data scientist to fully complement my statistics knowledge.
